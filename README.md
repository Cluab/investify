# Next.js Investment Platform

This is a small-scale investment platform developed using Next.js, React.js, and styled-components. It allows users to view and manage investment forms, including creating new forms, updating existing forms, and deleting forms.

## Features

- Home Page: The homepage displays all the investment forms in descending order of their action date. Each form preview includes the form title and a side menu of requirements such as Custodian Details, Other Information, and Certification.

- Form Actions: Users can perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on investment forms. They can create a new form, update existing forms, and delete forms.

- API Routes: Custom API routes are implemented in Next.js to handle the communication with the server for CRUD operations. The forms data is stored in a JSON file on the server-side.

- Data Storage: The investment form data is stored in a JSON file using the fs module to read and write data. This ensures persistence and retrieval of data between server restarts.

- Styling: CSS-in-JS solutions (styled-components) are used for styling the components, providing a modular and maintainable approach. The application is mobile responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.
